## Introduction

![](COVID-19.jpg)

Coronavirus is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is the new virus of the coronavirus family, which first discovered in 2019, which has not been identified in humans before. Common symptoms of **COVID-19** include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus.

The virus has shown evidence of human-to-human transmission. Transmission rate (rate of infection) appeared to escalate in mid-January 2020. And it has later declared as Pandemic by WHO due to high rate spreads throughout the world. It becomes more important to understand about this spread. 

## Data overview

+ This dataset contains 207 country profiles which allow us to explore the statistics on the coronavirus pandemic for every country in the world.

+ For a comprehensive assessment, this data track the impact of the pandemic across for 207 countries to study in depth the statistics on the coronavirus pandemic for every country in the world.

+ Every profile includes five main sections: cases, deaths, vaccinations, testing and government responses.

## My data

My research is an effort to analyze the ***Iraq*** data of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases over time. The main focus is to analyze the spread trend of this virus. I filtered out the data of interest and displayed it in the form of an interactive table:

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
library(plotly)
```

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
coviddata <- read.csv("owid-covid-data.csv",header = TRUE)
Iraq <- coviddata %>% filter(location=="Iraq")
Iraq_new <- Iraq %>% select(date,total_cases,new_cases,
                            total_deaths,new_deaths,tests_per_case,positive_rate)
Iraq_new <- na.omit(Iraq_new)

DT::datatable(Iraq_new,caption = htmltools::tags$caption('Table 1: COVID-19 data of Iraq.', style="color:black"),
              options = list(pageLength = 5,
                             initComplete = JS(
                               "function(settings, json) {",
                                "$(this.api().table().header()).css({'background-color': '#336699','color': '#fff'});","}")))
```

title: "The spread trend of covid-19 in Iraq"
---

Based on monthly data, I showed total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, tests per case and positive rate of covid-19 in Iraq. As shown in Table 2 below, we can find that the spread of covid-19 seems to have reached a peak in April 2021. After that, the epidemic situation showed a trend of improvement in May and June. Unfortunately, since July, the epidemic in Iraq has repeatedly occurred, with new cases even reaching new highs.

Iraq_new <- na.omit(Iraq_new)
```

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Iraq_new$month <- substr(Iraq_new$date,1,7)
data <- Iraq_new %>%
  select(-date) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%

  mutate_if(is.numeric, format, 3)
DT::datatable(data,caption = htmltools::tags$caption('Table 2: Mean of COVID-19 data by each month of Iraq.', style="color:black"),
              options = list(pageLength = 10,paging = FALSE,searching = FALSE,rownames= FALSE,
                             initComplete = JS(
